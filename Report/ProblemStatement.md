Problem Scenario : 

Assume working for an e-commerce company with a large dataset of consumer transactions. The collection includes information about each transaction, such as the client ID and the transaction value. Your objective is to create an algorithm capable of analyzing the dataset and identifying the top spenders. 

The organization wants to identify the clients who have spent the most money so that they can offer them special deals, prizes, or personalized recommendations. The organization hopes to improve customer satisfaction, build customer loyalty, and potentially increase revenue by recognising the top spenders. 

To address this challenge, users must evaluate the dataset and identify the clients who have spent the most money overall. The programme should process the dataset efficiently, handle numerous transaction conditions, and produce correct results. The technique should also be adaptable enough to handle changing dataset sizes and the number of top spenders.

The goal is to develop an algorithm that can effectively identify the top spenders in the dataset and return them in a list, along with their respective total spending amounts.

Problem Statement : 

The task is to determine and return the top spenders from a dataset of customer transactions. A top spender is a consumer who has spent the most money overall out of all the customers in the dataset.
