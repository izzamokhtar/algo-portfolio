The divide-and-conquer strategy and dynamic programming can both be used to solve the challenge of identifying the top spenders in a dataset. Let us contrast the two methods: 
Divide and Conquer: As seen in the code, the divide and conquer strategy entails iteratively dividing the dataset into smaller halves, identifying the top spenders in each half, and then merging and sorting the findings. This method offers the following features:
 
Pros:
- Conceptually straightforward and simple to grasp.
- Due to the divide and conquer strategy, it is capable of handling large datasets efficiently.
- Provides a clear separation of concerns between dividing the problem and combining the results.

Cons:
- Inefficient for small datasets or when the dataset cannot be distributed evenly.
- For large datasets, the sorting step after merging the results can be time consuming.
- Recursive function calls may result in increased memory usage.

Dynamic Programming: For this problem, the dynamic programming solution entails breaking it down into smaller subproblems and employing memoization or tabulation to store and reuse the outcomes of those subproblems. Here's one possibility for dynamic programming:
Create a memoization table to store the total spending for each customer encountered while traversing the dataset.
Traverse the dataset, updating the total spending for each customer in the memoization table.
Iterate over the memoization table and select the top spenders based on the total spending.

Pros:
- More effective for small datasets or when the dataset cannot be divided evenly.
- Avoids redundant computations by storing and reusing subproblem results.
- Can efficiently handle large datasets by removing the need for sorting.

Cons:
-Implementation may necessitate more careful design and understanding of the problem in order to identify the optimal subproblems and their associated dependencies.
-In comparison to the divide and conquer approach, the code may be more complex and difficult to understand.

Given the nature of the problem and the available dataset, the divide and conquer technique appears to be more appropriate. It separates the dataset naturally, allowing for parallel processing or optimisation of subproblems. Furthermore, the problem lacks overlapping subproblems, which is a crucial feature that dynamic programming often employs.
It is crucial to highlight, however, that the algorithmic technique used is determined by a number of criteria, including the characteristics of the dataset, the available computational resources, and the specific requirements and restrictions of the problem. Dynamic programming may be advantageous in particular situations, such as when there are overlapping subproblems or special performance constraints that favor memoization.
Finally, the best approach can be determined through experimentation, performance analysis, and consideration of the specific constraints and goals of the problem at hand.
