Analysis of an algorithm (best, worst, average).

To examine the algorithm employed in the preceding code, we will concentrate on the findTopSpenders function, which is the key algorithmic component. Examining the growth function for the worst-case, best-case, and average cases will be beneficial.

Worst-case Analysis:

In the worst-case scenario, we can assume that the dataset contains 'n' transactions and that each recursive call to findTopSpenders splits the dataset in half. This scenario occurs when the dataset cannot be divided evenly and each recursive call results in two approximately equal-sized halves.

Let T(n) denote the time complexity of the findTopSpenders function for a dataset of size 'n'. In the worst case, the algorithm follows a binary tree-like structure, with each level representing a recursive call on a halved dataset.

The technique executes O(n) operations at each level to partition the dataset, merge the top spenders, and sort them. As a result, in the worst-case scenario, the total number of levels is log2(n) (since the dataset is halved at each level). 

Consequently, the worst-case time complexity T(n) can be expressed as: T(n) = O(n) + 2 * T(n/2) + O(n log n).
Using the master theorem, we can determine the worst-case time complexity: T(n) = O(n log2n)
Hence, the worst-case growth function for this algorithm is O(n log2n).
 
Best-case Analysis: 

In the best-case scenario, the dataset contains only one transaction, and no additional recursive calls are made. This scenario occurs when the dataset originally comprises a single transaction.

The time complexity is constant in this example because the algorithm just generates a list of top spenders with a single entry. Therefore, the best-case time complexity is T(n) = O(1).

Hence, the best-case growth function for this algorithm is O(1).

Average-case Analysis: 

The average example assumes that the transactions in the dataset are distributed randomly. With each recursive call, the dataset is divided in half, and the number of transactions is halved until a base case is reached.

For the average case, we can assume that the algorithm follows a balanced binary tree-like structure. The average number of levels in this case is log2(n).
At each level, the algorithm performs O(n) operations to split the dataset, merge the top spenders, and sort them.

Hence, the average-case time complexity can be expressed as: T(n) = O(n) + 2 * T(n/2) + O(n log n).
Using the master theorem, we can determine the average-case time complexity: T(n) = O(n log2n)

Therefore, the average-case growth function for this algorithm is O(n log2n).

In summary, the time complexities for the algorithm employed in the supplied code are all O(n log2n). This means that the algorithm's speed scales logarithmically with input size, with the logarithmic factor increasing due to the recursive nature of the algorithm and the sorting operation done at each level.
