When developing this scenario on finding the top spender from the list of transactions 
per customer for an e-commerce company, there were a few constraints that needed to 
be evaluated and considered. The development of the Top Spender scenario involved 
considerations on the data types, the main objective and the incorporation of the 
constraints relating to time, space and value. Addressing these aspects allowed the 
organisation to effectively compile the dataset using the two algorithms (Divide and Conquer 
and Dynamic Programming) and identify the goal of finding the top spenders from the 
given dataset. 

Data type : 

- The main dataset considered the customer, where the Customer ID became the 
unique identifier that is essential in finding the top spender to prevent repetition 
of customer transactions being processed. 
- The transactions of each customer is also important whereby the value of 
customers’ purchases were taken note together with the unique Customer ID.

Objective Function : 

- The objective function is defined through finding a list of the top 10 customers 
who spent the largest total spending, so that the organisation may build stronger 
customer relationships by providing special offers and personalised recommendations.

Constraints : The constraints that was evaluated by the organisation for this scenario 
falls upon 3 categories: 

- Time Constraint : The algorithm chosen must provide the most efficient and timely results 
as to ensure the best performance taking account of the dataset’s size and 
organisation requirements.
- Space Constraint : The memory and storage resources must be utilised by the best algorithm, 
as the larger the datasets the more excessive the memory consumption would be.
- Value Constraint : The main objective being the list of top spenders, hence the calculation 
for the total spending and identification of customer’s transactions must be accurate to 
ensure the objective from the organisation is being fulfilled.
