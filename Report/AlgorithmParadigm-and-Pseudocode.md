Pseudocode:

This algorithm takes a given problem, here being a dataset and the need to find a top spender, the dataset is then divided into smaller subproblems.The subproblems are then evaluated independently and seen as a single individual problem. Finally, the final results are combined together to obtain the final solution, in this case being the top spender. This algorithm uses recursion implementation  to solve the problem.

The main function initialises the dataset of transactions and calls the ‘findTopSpenders’ function to find the top spenders.
The ‘findTopSpenders’ function takes a list of transactions as input and returns a list of ‘CustomerSpending’ objects representing the top spenders. It follows a divide-and-conquer approach:

- If the dataset contains only one transaction, it creates a ‘CustomerSpending’ object for that transaction and returns it as the result. 
- Otherwise, it splits the dataset into two equal halves, ‘leftHalf’ and ‘rightHalf’.
- It recursively calls ‘findTopSpenders’ on both halves to find the top spenders in each half.
- It then calls the ‘mergeTopSpenders’ function to merge the top spenders from both halves
- Finally, it returns the merged top spenders 

The ‘mergeTopSpenders’ function takes two lists of ‘CustomerSpending’ objects representing the top spenders from left and right halves and merges them:

1) It creates a ‘Map’ called ‘mergedSpendera’ to store the merged spending information for each customer 
2) It iterates over the top spenders from the left half and adds their spending amounts to the corresponding customer’s total spending in the ‘mergedSpenders’ map.
3) It does the same for the top spenders from the right half. 
4) After merging the spending information, it creates a new list called ‘sortedSpenders’ to store the merged spenders in descending order of their total spending.
5) It sorts the merged spenders based on their total spending using the ‘sort’ method and a custom comparator
6) Finally, it returns the top 10 spenders from the sorted spenders list (or fewer if there are less than 10 spenders)
